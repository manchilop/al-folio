Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying Software Engineering at Universidad de Sevilla and I have a passion for learning, I love learning new things.

I have always had a special interest in understanding how things work. How a company works, internet, computers. But I have realized that there is no use in reading a book and that's it, or learning a programming language and that's it. I believe that the good thing is to generate impact around me, go and with what I learned create something new that solves a problem. 
Do not stay just in learning, be creative and move and do new things. 

As a student, I have plenty of spare time and like spending that time learning new skills that will make me more useful and valuable. So that in the future I can start my own projects or play a big part in others. 

Now, I would love to join a company where I can put into practise what I know, but mainly learn and master those useful skills. I feel it is actually the best way to learn useful abilities and efficient ways of working. From inside a company that is performing well in the market.
